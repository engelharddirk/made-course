# Connections between wellbeing of peeaple and released movie genres
## this repository was created as part of my participation in the [MADE Course](https://oss.cs.fau.de/teaching/specific/made/) at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU).
## Description
This project contains a data pipeline that gets information of the OMDB Movie Database, life satisfaction data from eurostat, and happiness statistics from the world from the world happiness report 2023 (containing worldwide subjective happiness surveys for every year starting from 2005).
The goal is to collect and investigate the necessary data in order to (maybe) find a correlation between general happiness and released movie genres.
