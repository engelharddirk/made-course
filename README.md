# Connections between wellbeing of people and released movie genres
This repository was created as part of my participation in the [MADE Course](https://oss.cs.fau.de/teaching/specific/made/) at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU).
## Description
This project contains a data pipeline that gets information of the [OMDB Movie Database](https://www.omdb.org/), life [satisfaction data from eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/ILC_PW01__custom_71016/bookmark/table?lang=de&bookmarkId=59450ed9-2039-47a5-80b7-b34a948aef30), and happiness statistics from the world from the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) 2023 (containing worldwide subjective happiness surveys for every year starting from 2005).
The goal is to collect and investigate the necessary data in order to (maybe) find a correlation between general happiness and released movie genres.
The results of this project can be found in the [final report](https://github.com/engelharddirk/made-course/blob/main/project/report.ipynb).
